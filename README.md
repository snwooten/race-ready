# Race-Ready
A web app for tracking your race training progress to make sure you're ready for race day

This Node.js fitness app tracks usersâ€™ marathon training progress by accessing their running data through the Strava API. Race Ready uses Express, Sequelize, and Passport on the backend and React and React-Redux on the front.
This app is still a work in progress.
